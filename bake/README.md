## Getting Started with Docker Build with Bake


Docker Build with Bake is a feature within BuildKit that allows you to define and orchestrate multiple Docker image builds using a configuration file, offering more control and flexibility over the build process.

## Benefits of Bake:

- Organization: Manage multiple image builds within a single file, improving clarity and maintainability.
- Reproducibility: Ensure consistent builds across environments by defining all parameters in the configuration file.
- Parallelism: Build images for different platforms concurrently, saving time and resources.
- Flexibility: Customize build processes using variables, conditional logic, and external scripts.
- Integration: Combine Bake with other BuildKit features like build secrets and image signing.


## What is HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)?

It's a declarative language used to define build configurations for Bake, a feature within BuildKit that allows you to manage and orchestrate multiple Docker image builds through a configuration file.

Benefits of using HCL for Docker bake:

Clarity and Organization: HCL provides a structured and readable way to define build targets, dependencies, and build instructions, making your configuration easier to understand and maintain.
Flexibility: HCL allows you to leverage various functionalities like variables, conditional logic, and external scripts to tailor your build processes according to specific needs.
Reusability: You can define reusable components and share them across different projects or bake files.
Integration: HCL integrates well with other BuildKit features like multi-arch builds and build secrets.

 cd docker-image-intro/react/
 ```

## Create a Bake configuration file 

```
target "default" {
  context = "."
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
  # Other build options as needed
}
```

Save it as bake.hcl

## Build the images using docker buildx bake:

```
 docker buildx bake --file bake.hcl
```
