## Getting Started with Docker Build with Bake


Docker Build with Bake is a feature within BuildKit that allows you to define and orchestrate multiple Docker image builds using a configuration file, offering more control and flexibility over the build process.

## Benefits of Bake:

- Organization: Manage multiple image builds within a single file, improving clarity and maintainability.
- Reproducibility: Ensure consistent builds across environments by defining all parameters in the configuration file.
- Parallelism: Build images for different platforms concurrently, saving time and resources.
- Flexibility: Customize build processes using variables, conditional logic, and external scripts.
- Integration: Combine Bake with other BuildKit features like build secrets and image signing.

 git clone https://github.com/ajeetraina/docker-image-intro
 cd docker-image-intro/react/
 ```

## Create a Bake configuration file 

```
target "default" {
  context = "."
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
  # Other build options as needed
}
```

Save it as bake.hcl

## Build the images using docker buildx bake:

```
 docker buildx bake --file bake.hcl
```
