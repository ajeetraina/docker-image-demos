## Getting Started with Docker Build with Bake


Docker Build with Bake is a feature within BuildKit that allows you to define and orchestrate multiple Docker image builds using a configuration file, offering more control and flexibility over the build process.

```
 git clone https://github.com/ajeetraina/docker-image-intro
 cd docker-image-intro/react/
 ```

## 

```
target "default" {
  context = "."
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
  # Other build options as needed
}
```
